# Hello there!

I have always wanted to start a tech/gaming blog, but I kept putting it off. I finally decided to just start one and see where it goes. I will be posting about my experiences with tech, gaming, keyboards, and other things that I find interesting. I hope you enjoy my blog and I look forward to sharing my experiences with you.
