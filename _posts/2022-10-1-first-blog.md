# Hello there!

I have always wanted to start a tech blog, but I kept putting it off. I finally decided to just start one and see where it goes. I will be posting about my experiences with tech, gaming, keyboards, and other things that I find interesting. I hope you enjoy my blog and I look forward to sharing my experiences with you.

 Above is my current desktop set-up, which I am very happy with. I will be posting more about my set-up in the future.

## Website/blog setup 

Since I'm not that well-versed in web development or front-end development in general, I decided to just use Jekyll ([Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme) and GitHub Pages to host my blog.
